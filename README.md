# RecyclerViewProject
This project uses a RecyclerView to create a list, with each item being an iteration of the "example_item.xml" layout.  Also, there are two TextViews and two Buttons, one of each being "Insert" and "Delete" respectively.  These insert and delete new items at the specified position.  (I made it so that the position entered accurately is the position in the list, instead of the first position being "0".)  Each new item will say that it is a new item at the typed-in position.  Also, when an item is clicked on, its top line (TextView) will change to say "Clicked".  Finally, there is an image of a trash can that, when pressed, will delete the item.
